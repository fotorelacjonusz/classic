({gh-readme-pl}[This document is also available in Polish])

A community effort to ease making photo reports on SkyscraperCity forums.

== Getting Started

=== Downloads

* Current versions (MacOS & Linux for now): +
  {gh-releases}.
* Older versions (Windows & Linux only): +
  {sf-dload}.
* Nightly build, which is potentially unstable: +
  {gh-nightly}.

=== Building from Source

link:docs/INSTALL-SOURCE.adoc[Read this].

=== Basic Usage

. Toss some photos into the app
. Make some captions (or not)
. Click "Post on SSC"
. Wait for posts to be generated
. Copy prepared posts and and paste them into a web browser, in a desired thread
on forum

=== Further reading

Further information can be found in {gh-docs}[documentation pages], which have
been extracted from the old wiki.  Be informed that it wasn't carefully reviewed
since then, and some pieces may be outdated, but it should be valid in general.

There is also a {yt-tutorial}[video tutorial] on YouTube (for older program
versions, but still largely relevant).

== Credits

This application has been initially developed by Kamil Ostaszewski, who has
contributed a fully-featured application for Qt 4.8.
