= Security considerations

== FTP password

If present, password to FTP server is stored on disk, and "encrypted" with XOR
algorithm.

This is not very secure, be aware that ten-year-old can break it, really.
Though it's better than nothing...

== Imgur tokens

Imgur authorization is performed according to OAuth2 Implicit Grant flow and
happens in an external browser.  This is as secure as your browser.  However,
authorization token (which allows to do things on Imgur on behalf of user
and which is valid for ten years, but can be revoked in Imgur on user's demand)
is then sent unencrypted over localhost.  This kind of communication does not
leave your computer, but in theory it can leak if your computer is infected.
Passwords won't leak this way though.

For most users, this is probably an acceptable security risk, not bigger than
they are taking every day on.
