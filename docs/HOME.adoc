== Installing & building

It's easiest to use link:/releases[precompiled packages].  If you want to build
from the source code, read on link:INSTALL-SOURCE.adoc[this].

== User guide

It's really easy to use, you only need to:

. Toss some photos into the app
. Make some captions (or not)
. Click "Post on SSC"
. Wait for posts to be generated, then copy and paste them into a web browser,
  in desired thread on forum.

Example usage (for older program versions, but still largely relevant):
